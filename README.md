## Description
{
In this project I will be acting as a football analyst in Mchezopesa Ltd company to :
Predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (including rank of the respective team).
}
## Setup/Installation Requirements

Use Google Colab for data preparation and analysis.

Import pandas, Numpy libraries,  seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, math, pandas_profiling.

Loading datasets and previewing datasets.

Cleaning data; Renaming columns for uniformity, and dropping insignificant columns.

 Experimental design taken Perform your EDA
 
Perform any necessary feature engineering

Check of multicollinearity

Building a model

Approach 1: Polynomial regression model

* Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores

* Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores
 
Approach 2: Logistic regression model

  - Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw 
  
Cross-validate the model

Create residual plots for the model

Assess Heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test

Challenge the solution.
## Known Bugs
No known bugs.

## Technologies Used
The analysis was carried out in python using pandas and numpy.
